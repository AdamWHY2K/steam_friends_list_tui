üîÑ **Real-time Updates** - Instantly see changes as your friends come online, go offline, or start/stop playing games

üëÅÔ∏è **Last Seen Tracking** - View when offline friends were last online

üîê **Secure Authentication** - QR code authentication with encrypted token storage - authenticate once, use repeatedly

üåê **Cross-platform** - Works seamlessly (I hope) on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Authentication

The application uses Steam's official QR code authentication system for secure, convenient access:

### First-time Setup
1. Launch the application - a QR code will be displayed in your terminal
2. Open the **Steam Mobile app** on your phone
3. Navigate to the Steam Guard screen
4. Scan the QR code displayed in the terminal
5. Your authentication tokens will be encrypted and saved for future use

### Subsequent Usage
- The app automatically uses your saved authentication tokens
- No QR code scanning required unless tokens expire or become invalid
- Automatic re-authentication prompts when needed

### Security Features
- üîí Tokens are automatically encrypted using machine-specific keys
- üìÅ Stored in secure application data directory with restricted permissions
- üö´ Tokens cannot be transferred between devices
- üóëÔ∏è Manual token clearing: delete `auth_tokens.json` in the sftui data folder
